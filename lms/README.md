# Home Assistant Community Add-on: LMS Lyrion Music Server, Formerly the Logitech Media Server & SqueezeBoxServer

A complete and easy way to run [LMS Lyrion Music Server][LMS], formerly the [Logitech Media Server][sdf].

LMS formerly the [Logitech Media Server][sdf] is a cross-platform streaming media server that supports a wide range
 of formats, including AAC, AIFF, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV, and WMA.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpssc%2Fha-addon-lms%2F) or use the following addon repo manually https://github.com/pssc/ha-addon-lms/ in the supervisor addon tab following the stacked triple dots and selecting repositories.

This addon is based on the debian package for version 8.5.2 from https://lyrion.org/lms-server-repository/
| :warning: Unfortunately the latest Squeezebox Radio firmware (7.7.3) comes with a bug which prevents it from connecting correctly to LMS formerly the Logitech Media Server 8+. See https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver#sb-radio-and-logitech-media-server-8 for details and an easy mitigation. |
